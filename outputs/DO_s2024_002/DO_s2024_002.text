## IMMEDIATE RTMOVAL OF ADMINISTRATIVE  TASKS OF PI'BLIC SCH(X)L TEACIIERS

## I. RATIOITALE

The Department  of Education (DepEd) fervenfly  believes that the core of quality basic education is a vibrant and quality teaching  worldorce.  With this commitment, it is imperative  to build a work environment  for teachers that upholds and protects their welfare. This shall include  measures to protect the workload  and working hours of teachers.

Reports and studies have indicated that teachers are being assigned additional tasks that shift their focus from teaching.  The 2018 Teacher  Workload  Balalce Study identifred  approximately fifty (50) common  ancillaqr services  assigned to teachers in addition  to their regular teaching  load. These extra duties are often the result of understaffed  schools  being unable to provide  sufficient support services. The absence of standardized guidelines and a mechanism to review these tasks further compounds the issue. Research from various institutions suggests that the increase in administrative  assignments  signilicantly impacts teacher workload,  ultimately  affecting teaching quality and teacher well-being.

Through this Order, the Department  aims to remove the administrative tasks of teachers  to enable them to maximiz€  their time in actual classroom  teaching. With this endeavor, they shall be able to focus on the teaching and leaming process  and become effective  facilitators  of learning. Furthermore, this initiative by the Department shall help protect and uplift the welfare and wellbeing of public school  teachers  to support them to teach better which in turn shall rea-lize quality  learning among the Filipino learners.
