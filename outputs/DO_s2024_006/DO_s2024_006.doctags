<text><loc_60><loc_88><loc_444><loc_189>The 1987 Philippine Constitution states that '[tJhe State recognizes the complementary roles of public and private institutions in the educational system and shall exercise reasonable supervision and regulation of all educational institutions" (Art. XIV , Sec. 4.1). The Department of Education (DepEd) is mandated, as provided for in the Governance of Basic Education Act of 2001 (Republic Act No. 9155), to exercise regulatory and supervisory functions for both public and private educational institutions The Constitution further stipulates how the State has to 'protect and promote the right of all citizens to quality education at all levels ; through appropriate steps to make such education accessible to all" (Art. XIV, Sec. 1), and that the State shall maintain, and support a complete, adequate and integrated system of education relevant to the needs of the people and society" (Art. XIV, Sec. 2.1). These statements show how the Constitution does not delineate between the public sector and private sector.</text>
<text><loc_60><loc_192><loc_444><loc_278>The Philippine basic education system is a mixture of public and private education institutions intended to work complementarily to optimize the education of all Filipino children. The shift to the K to 12 Basic Education Program has brought about new opportunities for learners and graduates. With its mixed education system (i.e a system composed of both public and private educational institutions) , the country has become one of the performers in basic education in terms of the average number of years that children can expect to complete by the time are 18 years old, the age when most senior high school learners graduate from basic education. Sustained   improvements in student learning achievement, however, remain a challenge given the varying levels of children's access to quality education across the country. top they</text>
<text><loc_60><loc_282><loc_444><loc_342>When the Philippines transitioned to the K to 12 Basic Education Program, it also articulated the kind of graduates that the system aims to produce holistically developed Filipinos with 21st-century skills. This objective became the common for all educational institutions; both public and private, while the diversity of learning objectives, philosophies, and approaches that respond to specific social and cultural needs of learners and communities is recognized and guaranteed expression. Public and private educational institutions are intended to collaborate in working toward this end goal</text>
<text><loc_60><loc_347><loc_444><loc_457>One policy and program area that can further help improve access to quality education is public-private partnerships: Partnerships between public and private basic education institutions can enable the effective and efficient use of resources in the delivery of quality education. It can facilitate the effective harnessing of resources and strengths of private educational institutions to contribute to the achievement of national education goals (ADB-SHSSP TA, 2021). Current public-private partnership programs have shown that clearly articulated and strategically designed partnerships lead to better education delivery, and therefore, promote not only better student achievement and brokers inclusivity but also enable advantages for teachers and schools. For example, through programs under the Government Assistance to Students and Teachers in Private Education (GASTPE), financial assistance and subsidies for enrollment in private schools have been provided. These programs have been shown to have been successful in augmenting the lack of facilities and teachers in some public schools. Through these programs, learners can enroll in schools that</text>

However, public-private partnerships may not just be through these kinds of programs but can involve other efforts specific to other aspects to further facilitate the effective delivery of basic education.</text>
<text><loc_60><loc_79><loc_444><loc_187>As the national education system expands in response to the growing demands of an increasing school-age population, particularly in the public sector as can be seen in the number of public schools and teachers, maintaining the complementary roles of public and private educational institutions requires deliberate attention. A framework that provides a clear vision of the direction and forward wherein government and private educational institutions work complementarily, as envisioned by the 1987 Philippine Constitution, to achieve national education objectives is therefore presented through this policy document. This framework seeks to promote coherence in the development of the country's mixed education system, as the diverse contributions of various stakeholders are harnessed. Furthermore, this Framework aims to improve the collaboration between   public and private schools in providing access to quality education for Filipino learners, provide a basis for developing a shared understanding of the goals of public-private partnership programs, and facilitate consensus building among stakeholders. path</text>

<text><loc_59><loc_291><loc_444><loc_331>The DepEd seeks to transform the basic education system into one that is highly capable of ensuring that learners become holistically developed individuals with 21st_ century skills and attain high levels of competencies essential for them to thrive, live well, and become productive citizens in a democracy and who can contribute to the public good.</text>
<text><loc_59><loc_333><loc_444><loc_412>Cognizant of the Philippine Constitution's recognition of the complementary roles of public and private education institutions in the countrys national education system, DepEd shall transform itself into a learner-centered high-performance institution responsible for developing and harnessing both public and private schools, working together collaboratively, for the delivery of quality basic education to all learners. With an analytically and empirically sound policy framework on ways to optimize the roles of DepEd and other government agencies,  public schools and private educational institutions, the Philippine education system taken as a whole will see more rapid, sustained, and inclusive improvements in learning outcomes as well as the achievement of a near-zero learning poverty.</text>

In the case of indigenous peoples, the Philippine State shall XIV , Sec. 2.4); and further in the Indigenous Peoples Rights Act (IPRA) of 1997 it is stipulated that "[tJhe State shall provide equal access to various cultural opportunities to the indigenous cultural communities /indigenous peoples through the educational system, public or private cultural entities without prejudice to their right to establish and control their educational systems and institutions by providing education in their own language, in a manner appropriate to their cultural methods of teaching and learning (Sec. 30)" With regard to Muslim communities, the madrasah as a distinct educational institution and other aspects of Muslim education are recognized and supported by government.</text>

<text><loc_61><loc_62><loc_445><loc_111>Realizing the Constitutional vision of public and private education institutions performing complementary roles in the basic education system requires purposeful consideration in the different aspects of policy, programs, and governance. Based on consultations with both public and private education representatives, and informed by policy research, the following principles and thrusts are provided to the application, exercise, and promotion of complementarity: guide</text>
<ordered_list><list_item><loc_78><loc_114><loc_445><loc_224>Optimizing the roles of the public and private sectors in basic education. The country's mixed education system is driven by public schools and private education enterprises that function in a competitive but regulated market environment. This mixture allows Philippine society to take advantage of the strengths of the said drivers; and attenuate the weaknesses of a system that is located on either extremes of the spectrum that range from total government control to unfettered   private   enterprise Private education in healthy competitive environment can play an important role in raising the performance of the basic education system This forms part of the policy foundation and rationale for government spending through financial assistance and subsidy programs which allows the government to subsidize children's education in private schools to raise learning outcomes to socially optimal levels. Public-private   partnerships in education are part of the governments long-term strategy and not just temporary stop-gap measures.</list_item>
</ordered_list>
<text><loc_91><loc_229><loc_445><loc_369>DepEd shall gradually move toward the operationalization of this principle: for optimal investment in education as seen from the whole of society perspective, the basic amount of education subsidy per student shall be commensurate with the value of public benefits the government expects Filipino children to generate, after acquiring more and better education from public or private schools. If the same amount of education subsidy generates public benefits of equal value regardless of whether a person graduated from public or private schools, it is sound to adopt the principle that the same amount of education subsidy can also be extended to private school learners. The said principle is a reasonable starting point for determining the value of financial assistance to learners who prefer to enroll in eligible private schools of their choice. In applying this principle, however, other considerations need to be factored in One of those is the fact that some learners face higher cost of than others, depending on their location To ensure that learners receive the same amount of financial assistance in real terms, the estimated national average subsidy shall be adjusted to reflect cost-of-living differences across the national / Philippine geographic areas. In pursuing this principle; DepEd shall issue appropriate policy guidelines to make the necessary adjustments. living</text>
<text><loc_91><loc_374><loc_445><loc_445>Further, considering fiscal constraints, government education budget may not be enough to subsidize all learners who want to go to private schools. Under such situation, DepEd shall establish a system of rationing available financial assistance for learners wanting to enroll in eligible private schools of their choice. Available slots shall be rationed among learners that meet eligibility criteria designed to promote greater inclusion of children from poor families and disadvantaged communities. To a limited extent; the methodology for rationing available slots shall also be designed to give opportunities to learners who demonstrate high academic and intellectual aptitude or extraordinary</text>

A basic principle upon which complementarity can be fully operationalized is the recognition both public and private stakeholders of its meaning and corresponding implications; as articulated in this framework. A consensus on complementarity shall guide policy formulation, program design and implementation; the exercise of DepEds regulatory function, and interactions between the public and private sectors. Having a shared understanding of each other's roles and the principles upon which these roles are based will be essential to fully realizing the Constitutional intent.

<list_item><loc_70><loc_140><loc_452><loc_273>Recognition of the inherent value of private education institutions in the education system. The permanent mix of public and private institutions in the education system is valued and deemed a desirable characteristic of the countrys overall education framework. Even in the scenario when the government can address most of the resource gaps in public schools, as well as the resources to further expand its capacity and reach; the environment for the continued growth of private institutions shall be guaranteed. While private schools are tapped by the government through its service contracting and subsidy programs to ease congestion and address the lack of facilities in public schools, their value in the system is not limited to this. The existence of private schools and the services can provide are not merely a 'stop-gap solution. Private schools contribute to the diversity of providers, educational approaches, and even institutional cultures that enrich the system as a whole. Educational options for learners and their families are expanded through the existence of private schools, more so when a variety of types and program offerings are available.

The reasonable exercise of the governments regulatory function is one of the aspects that has been stipulated in the brief Constitutional provision on public and private education complementarity. The basic principle that governs supervision and regulation is ultimately the protection of the interest and welfare of the learner while ensuring the fair treatment of private schools and guaranteeing their rights and entitlements as legally existing enterprises. Private institutions shall be guaranteed access to clear and complete information; in a timely manner , on matters that govern their   supervision and regulation, and benefit from effective communication that would facilitate ample understanding of policies and requirements. While ensuring that the interest of the learner remains the primary consideration, the supervision and regulation of private institutions shall be facilitative and fair in line with the appreciation that these institutions serve as the complement of public institutions in the mixed basic education system: Due application of this principle and responsiveness to context shall be observed in the case of private institutions serving specific private ends and covered by distinct legal provisions (such as those of schools established and operated by and in partnership with indigenous peoples communities in light of provisions in the Constitution and IPRA cited above), and those providing free or subsidized</list_item>
