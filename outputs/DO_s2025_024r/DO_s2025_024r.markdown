6. Consistent  with Section 4.3 of Budget  Circular No. 2018-3 and DBM Circular Letter No. 2OO7 -6, the DBM-DepEd  Joint Circular No. Ol s. 2025 maintains  that'[t]here  is no distinction between  the duties of one teaching position and those of other teaching positions,"  and "teaching positions  are classified based on the personal qualifications  of the incumbents thereof  rather  than based on the preponderant  duties and responsibilities  and qualification requirements of ttre positions.'
7. Anchored on tl..e principle of competency-based  human resource  (HR), t}re Civil Service Commission  (CSC) approved  through CSC Resolution No. 25OO471 the Am.endment  to tlrc Qualification  Standards  (QS)  for  Teacher I-II[ Master Teacher  I-N, a  1 *ltool  Principal  I-N Positrons and the QS for  Neulg-Created  Teacher N-WI and Master Teacher  V Positions in the Departnant of Dducation (DepEd), establishing  the Education,  Training,  Experience,  and Eligibility requirements for each of t}le positions in the ECP System.

The PPST and PPSSH articulate  the professional  practice expectd of a quality  teacher and school head, respectively,  through well-defrned  domains,  strands,  and indicators that provide measures of professional  learning, competent  practice, and effective engagement.
9. Consistent with the State's commitment  to advancing the right of every Filipino learner to quality in basic education, DepEd remains faithful to providing merit- and competencybased career  advancement to teachers commensurate to their qualifications and competence by ensuring  that the system  incentivizes performance  and mastery in curriculum  content and pedagogical  approaches; thereby,  promoting their welfare, work motivation, and professional growth. The implementation  of the expanded  system of career  progression  for DepEd  teachers and school heads pursuant  to EO No. 174, s. 2022 and its IRR, and the modification  of the school stalfing parameters for Master Teacher  and School Principd positions  as stipulated in DBM-DepEd Joint Circular  No- 1, s. 2025 shall further ensure that the organization  and its workforce,  particularly  in the schools, are able to respond to challenges  and opportunities of the 2 l st century  with focus on the delivery  of quality, accessible, relevant, and liberating  basic education.

For purposes  of determining the baseline  level, any professional  or specialization units as may be required  in addition to any non-Education  degree shall be considered  equiva.lent  to a Bachelor's  degree in Education  (e.g- Bachelor's  degree plus 18 professional units in Education  with appropriate  major = tevel 6 based on Table 2.a). Additional  professional  and sp€cialization  units taken to earn the equivalent Education  degree (i.e.,  BEEd, BSEd) shall not correspond to units towards  the completion of a Master's degree.

- b. After determining  the baseline level, the HRMPSB  shall compute for tlle increments of the applicant's actual qualihcations  based on the submitted  documentary requirements. IncretEttt  shall refer to the difference between the applicant's actual quatfication  level and the corresponding  level of the minimum  (baseline) QS requirement of the position applied  for.

Only qualifications  that are relevant to the position  applied for and which exceed the minimum (baseline)  QS  requirements of the position shall be given points.

In tJle event that an applicant fails or refuses  to sign the RFSPP, the official Minutes of Deliberations  shall suffice to establish the integrity  of the assessment process. Applicants urith unsigned RFSPP  shall not, in any case, cause the delay in the finalization of the results of the comparative assessment  and shall not form pa,rt of the candidates  for reclassification until the issue on the assessment has been resolved.
3. 29- After the conduct  of the comparative  assessment, the HRMPSB  shall establish  the Comparative Assessment  Results  for Expanded Reclassification  {CAReER}  (see prescribed tentplate  in Annex  14) and prepare  the Plantilla  Allocation  List (PAL),  for onward  submission  to the SDS.

A copy of the CAReER shall be posted  by the HRMO in at least three (3) conspicuous physical places in DepEd olfices and schools concerned, concealing the applicants' personal information in accordance  with the Data Privacy Act. The only information that shall be made public  are the as-signed application codes, corresponding  scores obtained  by the applicant in each criterion, total scores,  and remarks.

Telephone  calls and short messaging services may be used only to accompany  the aforementioned  official communication  channels.

- 30- Based on the recommendation  of the HRMPSB, the SDS may designate  subcommittee/s in the districts, or oflices, as deemed practicable,  to assist the HRMPSB in the process  of comparative  assessment.

The sub-committee/  s, however,  shall only serve as an assistorial body.  The HRMPSB shall maintain  full responsibi.Iity  and accountability in the results of the comparative assessment, and therefore, shall be responsible in responding to queries and complaints  pertaining to the comparative  assessment.

32. The members of the sub-committee/s  shall be selected  from the pool of trained assessors  who have undergone  rigorous training, togetier  with the HRMPSB,  under the Career ProgrcrsloE Alscr.ors Progran and RSP Capabluty BuildfDS ProSraE, which focused on the conduct of multiple evaluation techniques in assessing the required competencies  based on the criteria, parameters,  and protocols  stipulated  in this Enclosure.
