## GUIDELINES ON THE PAYMENT OF OVERTIME SERVICES OF TEACHERS

## Rationale

- 1 Republic Act (RA) No. 4670, otherwise known as the Magna Carta for Public School Teachers, entrusts the Department of Education (DepEd) with the responsibility of ensuring the proper implementation of its provisions through the development of relevant guidelines and the preparation of the necessary budgetary requirements for the prescribed benefits.

Under Rule III , Section 14 of RA No. 4670, co-curricula and out of school activities and any other activities outside of what is defined as normal duties of any teacher shall be an additional compensation of at least twenty-five per cent of the teacher's regular  remuneration after such teacher has completed at least six (6) hours of actual classroom teaching a paid day .

- 2 In conjunction to the abovementioned, Memorandum Order No. 228 dated 29 March 1989, issued under the administration of President Corazon â‚¬ Aquino, authorized the rendition and payment of overtime services for government personnel.
- 3 In line with this, the Civil Service Commission (CSC) and the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) issued Joint Circular No. 02, s. 2015 dated 25 November 2015 the Policies and Guidelines on Overtime Services  and Overtime for Government Employees   prescribing the policies and guidelines on the rendition of overtime services and corresponding   remuneration, either through Compensatory Time Off (CTO) or Overtime This issuance granted flexibility to agencies in authorizing overtime work and processing payments. Pay Pay .
- 4 To harmonize its internal practices with this joint circular, DepEd issued Department Order (DO) No. 30, 2016, which established policies and guidelines on overtime services and payment for non-teaching personnel.
- 5 teaching personnel, however , services rendered beyond regular duties or outside regular work hours where payment of honorarium or overtime pay is not possible are instead compensated through Vacation Service Credits (VSC) pursuant to DO No. 013, $. 2024, or the Revised Guidelines on the Grant of Vacation Service Credits for Teachers. For
- 6 Furthermore, DepEd Memorandum (DM) No. 291 s. 2008 or the Guidelines on the Implementation of CSC Resolution No. 080096 on Working Hours for Public School Teachers provides that overtime pay can be only claimed for actual teaching and/or work performed within the school premises, thus limiting the scope of remunerable overtime for teachers.
- 7 Recent DepEd initiatives, such as DepEd Order No. 005, s. 2024 or the Rationalization of Teachers Workload in Public Schools and Payment of Teaching Overload; sought to streamline the workload of teachers by

maxirnizing  their time on actual classroom teaching  and related duties, thereby reinforcing  the focus on teaching and learning  processes.

However,  despite these policies and recent efforts, situations still arise where teachers must render additional services beyond tJreir regular work hours. While the topic of monetary compensation for such services has been raised, clear guidelines for its implementation  remain  lacking-

- Consistent  witJl the DeparEnent's commitnent to ensure the weUare of teachers and recognizing theA valuable contributions, this Order is issued to properly compensate teaching personnel  for the additional  time and effort ttrey devote  to their work and to establish a clear framework for the eflicient  and effective  implementation  of overtime  pay for teachers. 8
