<h2>GUIDELINES ON THE RECRUITMENT, SELECTION, AND APPOINTMENT TO HIGHER TEACHING POSITIONS</h2>
<h2>I Rationale</h2>
<ul>
<li>1 Section 2(2), Article IX(B) of the 1987 Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines provides that  "appointments in the Civil Service shall be made only according to merit and fitness to be determined, as far as practicable, and, except to positions which are policy determining, primarily confidential, or highly technical, by competitive examination. Moreover, Section 21 (1) Chapter 5 Subtitle A, Title I, Book V of Executive Order (EO) No. 292, titled the Administrative Code of 1987, provides under Recruitment and Selection of Employees that "opportunity for government employment shall be open to all qualified citizens and positive efforts shall be exerted to attract the best qualified to enter the service. Employees shall be selected on the basis of fitness to perform the duties and assume the responsibilities of the positions: " Additionally, Section 21 (4) of the same book states that "leJach department or agency shall evolve its own screening process; which may include tests of fitness, in accordance with standards and guidelines set by the Commission. Promotion boards shall be formed to formulate criteria for evaluation; conduct tests or interviews; and make systematic assessment of training experience.</li>
