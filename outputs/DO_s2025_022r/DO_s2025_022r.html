<h2>POLICY GUIDELINES ON THE INSTITUTIONALIZATION OF THE SCHOOL SPORTS CLUB IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS</h2>
<h2>RATIONALE</h2>
<p>Sports have always been an avenue for promoting physical fitness and wellness Sports as a physical   activity build on physical   literacy, which is an essential component of a healthy   lifestyle.  Physically   literate   individuals are competent, confident, and motivated to move Every child is predisposed to be active if the environment encourages participation. Article 31 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child recognizes the right of the child to rest and leisure; to engage in play and recreational activities appropriate to the age of the child, and to participate freely in cultural life and the arts. Article XIV Section 19 of the 1987 Philippine Constitution declares that the State shall promote physical education and encourage  sports programs, league competitions, and amateur sports, including training   for international   competitions, to foster self-discipline, teamwork, and excellence for the development of a healthy and alert   citizenry . All   educational institutions shall in cooperation with athletic clubs and other sectors.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization Guidelines on Physical   Activity and Sedentary Behavior require children and adolescents to do at least an average of 60 minutes per of moderate to vigorous-intensity, mostly aerobic, physical activity, across the week to limit the amount of time spent sedentary, particularly the amount of recreational screen time. However, each school traditionally   provides a sedentary setting with at least 6 hours spent sitting inside the classroom. As children move through adolescence, become less physically active. In 2016, the Philippines was the country with the highest prevalence of insufficient activity in adolescents (Guthold, et.al. , 2019). Meanwhile, the results of the 2022 Philippine Physical Activity Report Card conveyed that most Filipino children and adolescents in the country fail to meet the recommended amount of physical activity for health by the World Health Organization and that there is an increasing trend in sedentary behaviors (Cagas, et.al. 2022) . Our youth need to participate physical activities at moderate-to-vigorous intensity levels for at least 60 minutes to optimize their health. To improve the physical fitness of learners, there is a need for a school sports program that will supplement and complement the PE curriculum, increasing the time allotted for physical activity afforded during the MAPEH period. day being day they daily</p>
<p>Section 9 of Republic Act No 9155, or the "Governance of Basic Education Act of 2001, transfers all   functions, programs, and activities of the Department of Education related to sports competition to the Philippine Sports Commission (PSC) However, the program for school sports and physical fitness remains an integral part of the basic education curriculum. Similarly, Section 8 of Republic Act No. 10533, otherwise known as the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013, underscores the need to enhance basic   education by   implementing   programs that address the physical, intellectual, psycho-social, and cultural needs of learners, including but not limited to programs for learners with disabilities.</p>
<p>In support with the Department's  agenda  to ensure an enabling  learning environment and the well-being  of learners,  the Bureau of lcarner-Support ServicesSchool Sports Division (BLSS-SSD), endeavors to integrate  more physical activity into the curriculum,  to reduce sedentary behavior through  a separate  daily period in the school  program for sports, to make sports participation more accessible to a wide spectrum of Filipinos,  and to encourage every  child to play, leam and engage in at least one sport. The School Sports Club (SSC) serves as an extension of formal learning and a supplement  to classroom lessons by providing fun and engaging sporting activities  that align with students' abilities, interests,  competencies,  and advocacies. It recogrrizes  the diverse  capabilities  of all learners and harnesses  the transformative  power of sports to empower individuals and contribute positively to society.</p>
<p>The SSC extends beyond physical activity.  It  fosters holistic development  by promoting physical  health, enhancing social skills, instilling discipline,  and encouraging  teamwork and leadership.  Through  sports, learners  develop resilience, self-confidence,  and a sense of camaraderie that prepares them for real-life challenges-  Additionally,  participation  in organized sports provides  leamers with opportunities  for self-expression,  stress relief, and a balanced lifestyle  that supports their academic  pursuits.  By integrating sports into education,  the SSC plays a crucial role in shaping  well-rounded individuals  who are not only physically active but also mentally resilient  and socially  responsible,  ultimately  contributing  to national progress and development-</p>
<h2>II. SCOPE</h2>

<p>The Comprehensive  School Sports Program  (CSSP) supports the Department of Education's (DepEd) thrust of promoting the holistic  development  of all leamers through active engagement  in sports and physical  activities. The CSSP has three (3) major components  namely: (U Sports Ed;ucoiJoa rrre'd Stz;ndrrrds which contains the program to institutionalize Sports Clubs in Public Schools, the development  of the Manual  of Operations  for the SSC, the Sports Manual  for Teachers  and karners, and the Philippine Games Handbook,  (2) Sport-s as learrter Supl,€rt Progrann, which oflers the Sports Supplies Equipment  Enhancement  and Distribution Program (SSEEDP),  the National Orientation-Workshop  of School Heads &amp; Division Focal Persons on the Institutionalization  of SSC and the Capacity Building for SSC Facilitators,  and (3) School Sports Cotryrcdtlon  for the Sports Club Festiva-ls, Extramurals  and DepEd Sports Skills Demonstration Contest.</p>

<p>The SSC progr.rm  is framed within the Comprehensive  School Sports  Pmgram. The framework  for the SSC is integra-l in providing opportunities for leamers  to engage  in fun and active physical  fitness, as well as for them to leam basic life skills and values through various SSC activities.</p>
<p>At the center of the program  is the learner, represented by a human with two tones (blue and red), which signifres gender equality. At the same time, the dJmamic movement symbolizes that the learner is at play and having fun. The program provides  learners  \rrith an opportunity to participate  in a variety of competitive  and recreational sports  activities  within  and among schools. The outer part of the framework  reflects  the four (4) SSC program  principles:</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: 'b. ';">Developmentally  approprtate practlce, transition activities  that include skill and frtness development,  play, lead-up games from child to adolescent,  their changing capabilities,  and their varied  physical, mental, cognitive,  a,ffective,  and kinesthetic  needs</li>
<li style="list-style-type: 'e. ';">Incluslvc, because it welcomes  all leamers  regardless  of their abilities, interests,  sports experiences, or backgrounds,  age, and gender.  This includes leamers  with physical, s€nsory,  and intellectual  disabilities.</li>
</ol>
<p>T</p>
<p>dr</p>
<ul>
<li>Lifelong  succecs-orlented,  because  it acknowledges that the mastery of sports takes time. Lifelong participation  and excellence  in sports can best be achieved  through a solid foundation of movement  skills and sport-specific  skills,  participation  in a variety of sports at a young  age, and fu rther specialization. c</li>

<p>At Key Stage 1, leamers are introduced  to fundamental movement and motor skills while developing personal and cultural a\pareness-  This stage emphasizes the development of leamers at their young age.</p>
<p>In Key Stage  2, learners improve their skills by engaging in various sports/dance movements  and executing mature movement  skill patterns in a sport arrd dance context.  They leam to demonstrate  movements in promoting health and wellness for active and healthy living.</p>
<p>Moving  into Key Stage 3, students  start focusing their skills on a specific sport/dance while  still participating  in multiple physical activities. This stage also deepens  their understanding  of movements  in promoting  health wellness  for active and healthy living.</p>
<p>Finally,  Key Stage 4 aims for sports/dance  proflciency while enjoying the games. It promotes a lifelong commitment to physical activit5r while fostering  2 l st-century skills such as critical thinking, collaboration,  and problem-solving, ensuring  that students remain active and healthy throughout  adulthood.</p>
