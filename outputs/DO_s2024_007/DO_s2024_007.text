## POLICY GUIDELINES ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE REVISED SCHOOL-BASED MANAGEMENT (SBM) SYSTEM

## RATIONALE

The implementation of the Republic Act (RA) 9155, otherwise known as the Governance of Basic Education Act of 2001, provides direction for decentralizing the system of management and governance at the school level and further recognizes the role of local government units and other stakeholders as partners in education service delivery The said Republic Act allows for an innovative approach to empower school heads and their personnel to collaborate with the community in ensuring the 'delivery of quality basic education and achieving improved learning outcomes. School heads, in consultation with internal and external stakeholders, are provided the opportunity to address and decide on issues and concerns directly involving day-to-day school operations.

In 2012, the Department of Education (DepEd) provided the parameters for exercising decentralized decision-making at the school level through the DepEd Order (DO) No. 083 , 2012, the Implementing Guidelines on the Revised School-Based Management (SBM) Framework; Assessment Process; and Tool (APAT) In this policy, SBM, as a reform thrust, was broadened to better highlight the learners as the center of SBM practice and to encompass the diverse realities of learning contexts uniquely occurring within specific geographic; social, cultural, economic, political, and environmental make-up in societies.

However, in the course of institutionalizing SBM, various implementation gaps emerged. Across Regions, Schools Divisions; and Schools; these areas for improvement were common, differentiated due to contextualized practices. Practitioners at the school level contended that its implementation was laden with voluminous and repetitive documentary requirements resulting in additional tasks assigned to the teaching personnel. These documentary requirements were used as means of verification to ascertain the SBM level of   practice based on Similarly, the operationalization of the scoring system became challenging due to the exercise of an arbitrary approach to determining the outcome indicators that would support the level of practice declared by schools. yet

In response to the implementation concerns, a review commenced to further identify other policy issues. In the review, the need to the SBM framework became apparent. Recently, innovative education programs, projects, and activities have been introduced and taken root in the Philippine education system in response to the current update

Department Order   (DO) No. 083, 2012, Implementing Guidelines on the Revised School-Based Management (SBM) Framework; Assessment Process and Tool (APAT)

international organizations, private companies, business enterprises, corporate foundations, cooperatives, and other concerned private individuals.13

## IV. POLICY STATEMENT

This Policy on School-Based Management is in line with the provisions of the Republic Act (RA) 9155. As such, schools, their personnel, and community stakeholders are accorded the opportunity to collectively plan and decide on their delivery of quality basic education, achievement of learning outcomes, and transformation into effective organizations.

Moreover, this policy serves as an enabling mechanism to address thë challenges in basic education. The effective and efficient implementation of the SBM shall contribute to realizing holistically developed Filipino learners with 21st-century skills who are Maka-Diyos, Makatao, Makakalikasan, and Makabansa, aligned with the sector outcome that is the Basic Education Filipino learners have the physical, cognitive, socioemotional, and moral preparation for civic participation and engagement in postsecondary opportunities in their local, national, and global communities.14 Likewise, the implementation of the SBM shall further contribute in achieving the national which is All Filipinos are able to realize their full potential and contribute meaningfully to a cohesive nation "15 goal,

All schools shall endeavor to cultivate a culture of continuous improvement. Alongside this, schools are expected to regularly undergo self-assessment using the SBM selfassessment checklist for purposes of progress monitoring and evaluation.

## V: GUIDELINES AND PROCEDURES

The continuous improvement process is a fundamental anchor in SBM that ensures the transformation of all schools into effective organizations. The continuous improvement process nurtures an ideal school culture that promotes school self reflection, self-management, and self-improvement.

Self-reflection pertains to understanding a schools current situation by describing the roots of issues, concerns, and areas for improvement and identifying responsive courses of action. Learning is the result of self-reflection.16 It allows the school to have a broader perspective of its situation which aids in the development of strategies that shall address

gaps, and consequently, the school shall have a deeper understanding of its own behavior.17

Self-management pertains to planning, organizing, leading, and managing resources to ensure the attainment of organizational goals.18 It also means the ability of schools to continuously learn new ways to support improvement efforts and expand community networks for sustainable partnerships.

Self-improvement enhances the capacity to address problems, refine processes and procedures, innovate on the delivery of services, and continuously apply effective and efficient practices in school operations. Self-improvement is a purposive approach to initiating educational reforms that aim to enhance learning outcomes as well as strengthen the schools capacity for managing change. 19

SBM aims to achieve both people and organization effectiveness in realizing organizational success: SBM seeks to sustain improvements in the multi-faceted areas of school operations. The school head harnesses professional competencies to meet the challenges in management and governance.

Thus, the guiding principles applicable to school heads as stipulated in the Philippine Professional Standards for School  Heads,20   (PPSSH) are consistently aligned in the practice of school-based management.

## A Principles

The SBM as an organization effectiveness framework and the PPSSH as a people effectiveness framework have common and shared principles which are summarized as follows.21

Learner-centered and Inclusive. Learner-centered and inclusive education is needs-based and rights-based, learning-focused, developmental-stage appropriate, gender and culture-sensitive, environmentally safe, and accessible.

This also means that a conducive learning environment is maintained to support the teaching and learning process. The conditions in school are made free of and protected from discrimination, exploitation; abuse, violence, and bullying which "may be based on any ground such as age, ethnicity, sex, sexual orientation and gender identity, language, religion, political or other opinion; and national or social origin,"22 among others-

Strategic Planning: A network of leadership and governance guides the education system to achieve its shared vision, mission, and goals making them responsive and relevant to the context of diverse environments. By planning strategically, improvement efforts are made more evidence-based and decisions are well-informed with the responsible use of school-community data and resources.

Leadership and Governance. Setting directions is crucial in realizing goals for the benefit of learners. This principle guides internal and external stakeholders in achieving a shared vision, thus, making schools responsive to the context of diverse environments Transparency and accountability also describe the network of leadership and governance that schools establishDecisions, action plans, and results are the responsibility of the school management, together with stakeholders.

Stakeholder Participation. Engaging the community promotes the strengthening of organizational support. Through this principle, collective ownership of improvement efforts is shared between the school and the stakeholders, and collaboration to address concerns is encouraged. The school community organizes, mobilizes, and manages resources to foster a high level of commitment toward achieving improved learning outcomes.

Excellence; This principle focuses on the improvement of people and organizations to support learners in becoming holistically developed individuals: Excellence also to the sustained efforts to in place effective school practices and efficient processes. applies put

Additionally, the pillars outlined in the DepEds Basic Education Development Plan?3 also serve as guiding principles with which SBM is also aligned. These pillars are as follows:

Access. All school-age children, out-of-school youth, and adults accessed relevant basic learning opportunities.

EquityDisadvantaged school-age children and youth, and adults benefited form appropriate equity initiatives.

Quality . Learners complete K-12 basic education; having successfully attained all learning standards that equip them with the necessary skills and attributes to pursue their chosen paths.

Resiliency and Well-being. Learners are resilient and know their rights, and have the life skills to protect themselves and exercise their education related rights, while being aware of their responsibilities as individuals and as members of society.

23 Department Order (DO) No. 024, s. 2022, Adoption of the Basic Education Development Plan 2030

## B. Conceptual Framework

Figure 1. SBM Conceptual Framework

The framework shows the active involvement of school-community stakeholders in SBM practice. These internal and external stakeholders observe self-reflection, selfmanagement, and self-improvement to influence the sustainable development of the various dimensions of school operations. As these school dimensions are improved, the achievement of higher learning outcomes is realized, and Filipino learners are developed with the necessary 2st-century skills. Explicit in this SBM framework and consistent with the education plan of the Department, "Filipino learners are envisioned to be holistically developed in basic education; acquiring 2Ist-century skills that will enable them to manage oneself; build connections; inquire; innovate, stay nimble; and serve beyond self: must take pride in Filipino national identity and nationhood and to flourish and have life skills, economic prosperity; sociopolitical stability, unity in diversity; be  responsive; competitive; and live in a sustainable world by upholding the core values: Maka-Diyos, Makatao; Makakalikasan; at Makabansa. "24 They aspire

Alongside the school strategic planning process and active stakeholder engagement is an established school monitoring and evaluation which is integral to effective and inclusive school-based management   and embedded in all   phases of the SBM practice. This shall encourage self-assessment and, consequently, self improvement which is essential in becoming responsive organizations.

24 Department Order (DO) No. 24, s. 2022, Adoption of the Basic Education Development Plan 2030

The following areas in school operations, defined as SBM dimensions, shall be enhanced to produce ideal Filipino learners and to achieve organizational success:

Curriculum and Teaching. School personnel and stakeholders work collaboratively to enhance learning standards to continually build a relevant and inclusive learning community and achieve improved learning outcomes.

ensure equitable access to a learner-centered, motivating, healthy, safe, secure, inclusive, resilient; and enabling learning environment and to achieve improved learning outcomes.

Leadership. School personnel and stakeholders are empowered and actively engaged in taking on appropriate   leadership roles and responsibilities to continuously improve the school for improved learning outcomes.

Governance and Accountability . The school and its community come together to take responsibility for ensuring participation, transparency, and accountability, as well as the implementation of a plan to continuously improve the delivery of basic education services, organizational health, and performance for improved learning outcomes.

Human Resource and Team Development. School personnel collaborate to continuously improve individual capabilities and team capacity to create an environment that shall yield high performance for improved learning outcomes.

Finance and Resource Management and Mobilization. The school judiciously manages and mobilizes resources to support programs, projects, and activities that contribute to the improvement of learning outcomes.

## C. Degree of Manifestation of SBM Practice

The degree by which the SBM practice is manifested by schools provides a basis for their continuous improvement. Schools are encouraged to use the results of their self-assessment as input to their strategic and implementation plans.

| Degree of Manifestation   | Description                                                           |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Always manifested         | An SBM indicator is consistently   observed and achieved at all times |
| Frequently manifested     | An SBM indicator is most of the time observed and achieved            |
| Rarely manifested         | An SBM indicator is sometimes observed and achieved                   |
| Not manifested yet        | An SBM indicator is neither observed nor achieved                     |

All schools shall endeavor to frequently manifest or always manifest school practices and learning outcomes expressed as SBM indicators in the selfassessment checklist.

## D. SBM Self-Assessment

The purpose of the schools self-assessment using the SBM Self-Assessment Checklist (see Annex A) is for continuous improvement. The continuous improvement reached by a school is the intrinsic reward for implementing schoolbased management.

## 1. Self-Assessment and Technical Assistance (TA) Calendar

Self-assessment is embedded as a process resulting from school management and operations. Therefore, schools may undergo self-assessment as many times as deemed necessary . This policy, however , recommends and encourages schools to observe a calendar (refer to Figure 2) for the conduct of Self-Assessment and provision of Technical Assistance.

Figure 2. Self-Assessment and Technical Assistance Calendar

## 2. Essential   Steps in the Conduct of Self-Assessment by Schools and Provision of Technical Assistance by the SDOs

STEP 1. The school undergoes self-assessment. This step is ideally done during the fourth grading period of the current school year.

- a The school refers to the SBM Self-Assessment Checklist (see Annex A) to guide its process of continuous improvement.
- b The school invites its internal and external stakeholders to participate in the self-assessment which includes an analysis of observed school practices and achieved learning outcomes stated as SBM indicators in the self-assessment checklist.

STEP 2. The school integrates the results of its self-assessmentin its strategic plan as identified improvement areas and in the (adjusted) implementation plan as a school program, project, or activity for continuous improvement. This step is recommended to be done during the vacation months of learners to the start of the new school year. prior

STEP 3. The school implements its for continuous improvement of practices and learning outcomes. This step is suggested to be done during the first t0 third grading periods of the current school year. During this period, the school also: plan

- a Monitors its progress.
- b. Undergoes subsequent self-assessments as deemed necessary.
- Arranges an invitation to its SDO to provide technical assistance. The school and its SDO ensure that classes and regular operations are not disrupted.
- c.l. The school establishes its context with the SDO based on the results of progress monitoring and the status of SBM implementation.
- c.2. The SDO recommends   specific courses of action that are appropriate to the school's current status and context.
- The school and SDO agree on priority improvement areas in the various SBM dimensions. c.3.

After all the steps have been observed, the school goes back to STEP 1 and conducts another self-assessment for continuous improvement.

## E. Documentary Requirements

Relative to the implementation of SBM, the practice of attaching various means of verification as documentary evidence to attest to the level of practice is no longer necessary. prior

On the other hand, the SBM Self-Assessment Checklist shall be accomplished as a record of the status of SBM implementation and continuous improvement of schools. It shall also serve as the basis for the provision of technical assistance from the Schools Division Offices. Agreements between the school and its SDO shall be documented in the Remarks column of the checklist.

## F Roles and Responsibilities of the Different Governance Levels

Recognizing that continuous improvement through the implementation of SBM is a shared goal of the Schools and community, SDOs, ROs, and the Central Office, the following provisions enumerate the roles and responsibilities across governance levels-

- 1 The School. Together with its internal and external stakeholders, the school strengthens its intrinsic motivation to continuously improve practices, processes, and learning outcomes through the implementation of school-based management.

The school head shall assume the role of the School SBM Coordinator or the focal person. Consistent with the condition in the PPSSH, "School heads have the authority, responsibility and accountability for taking care of people in schools (people effectiveness) while maximizing organizational performance and health (school effectiveness) by setting the direction of schools; managing their systems and processes, promoting quality teaching and learning, nurturing themselves and others and engaging stakeholders in initiatives towards the improvement of school communities: "25

The function of the school head as the SBM focal person shall not be delegated nor reassigned, especially to any teaching personnel.

- 2 Schools Division Office. The SDO is responsible for   providing technical assistance and extending guidance to schools in their process of self improvement. It is also   responsible for   ensuring that the results of self assessment consistently capture the realities of schools.
