<p>BENEFITS PAYMENT POLICY SERVICE TEACHERS TEACHING LOAD WORK HOURS</p>
<p>(Enclosure to DepEd Order No. 005, s. 2024)</p>
<h2>RATIONALIZATION OF TEACHERS' WORKLOAD IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND PAYMENT OF TEACHING OVERLOAD</h2>
<h2>I RATIONALE</h2>
<p>The Department of Education (DepEd) strives to cultivate a work environment that ensures quality   teaching workforce. In support of this thrust, the Department institutionalized the Philippine Professional Standards for Teachers (PPST) to guide all teachers in public schools and clearly set expectations on teacher performance, attainment of proficiency, and professional development.</p>
<p>However, DepEd acknowledges that teacher welfare is as important as teacher quality . Guided by the Republic Act (RA) No. 4670 or the Magna Carta for Public School Teachers, the holistic well-being of teachers is prioritized by ensuring fair and equitable distribution of teacher workload.</p>
<p>Section 13 of the Magna Carta affirms that actual classroom teaching hours shall not be more than six (6) hours a except in exigencies of service where teachers may render more than six (6) hours but not exceeding eight (8) hours of actual classroom teaching a day. Consequently, any actual teaching performed beyond six (6) hours, as well as any other activities outside their normal teaching duties as stipulated in Section 14, shall be compensated accordingly. day</p>
<p>In response to the precepts of the Magna Carta, several Department issuances were released to provide implementing guidelines on the working hours of public school teachers. DECS Order No. 039, 1990, Deployment and Assignment of Public School Teachers, reiterated the provision of RA 4670 on the actual teaching hours. The said Order has also assigned teaching load to other tasks like class advising duties and coaching, as well as handling of special /remedial classes.</p>
<p>With guidance from the Civil Service Commission (CSC), the Department also released DepEd Memorandum (DM) No 291, 2008, Guidelines for the Implementation of CSC Resolution No. 080096 on Working Hours for Public School Teachers, and DepEd Order (DO) No. 016, 2009, Addendum to DepEd Memorandum No.  291, 2008, which further clarified school teachers; as government employees, are not exempted from the eight-hour work of which six (6) hours shall be allotted to actual classroom teaching and the two (2) hours shall be engaged to tasks incidental to the teaching-learning process. day,</p>
<p>Despite the issuance of the aforementioned guidelines, various interpretations remain and are still rampant due to the absence of clear operational definition of governing principles, implementing arrangements across governance   levels, parameters in determining workload and overload, and monitoring and evaluation mechanisms and procedures.</p>
<p>Through this Order, the Department aims to maximize teachers' time spent on actual classroom teaching and related duties,   enabling them to focus on improving the teaching and learning processes that occur within classrooms. This policy is designed enhance  teacher quality, promote teacher welfare, and ultimately, contribute to improved learning outcomes.</p>
